# NLP Sentiment Analysis - Toxic Comments - with sklearn vs. Keras
* The notebooks contain NLP sentiment classifications of comments into several class labels of several types of verbal violence.
* The dataset is from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge.
* The first notebook provides a linear baseline for this contest.
* The prediction that I submitted to kaggle got an avg AUC score of 0.83514.
* In the second notebook I chose to use embedding and bidirectional LSTM (using Keras) as the prediction model.
* Using the deep learning model, the predictions I submitted to kaggle got an avg AUC score of 0.97163 !
* This means that the deep learning model increased the score by more than 13 percentage points!
